# In my last LearnMod, I mentioned variables.
# Variables are like containers. They have a name and they have a value.
# They can be defined/made like this:

greeting = "Hello! How are you?"

# The name of the variable in this example is
# greeting. It's value is "Hello! How are you?".
# You can print variables using the print() command
# which we talked about in the What is Python? LearnMod.
# It would look like this:

FavouriteFood = "Pizza"

print(FavouriteFood)

# The value of the variable is Pizza
# So when we print out the variable, it will print its value.


# We can also join values also
# known as concatenation. It looks like this:

schoolOpinion = "boring."
print("School is really " + schoolOpinion)

# As you can tell, we are printing out "School is really " and then our value.
# There is also another way that you can accomplish the same thing:
# It looks like this:

videoGame = "Minecraft"
print(f"I love {videoGame}")

# The above example is called an fstring because it
# has the letter f next to it.




# This is part 1 of What are variables! Make sure to
# do part 2 and to do the challenge.py to verify you
# know everything that we covered!

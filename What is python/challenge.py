# Hello! This is the challenge.py file!
# By the way, make sure you have read the WhatIsPython.py
# file or you might get stuck trying to complete these questions!


# You must make the python code below print
# out the words "Hello World!".

text = "1234567890"

print(text)


# You can edit the code above as much as you like!
# The only thing you have to do is make it say Hello World!
# You can also look online if you're really stuck!


# When you're done, then that means you have
# finished this LearnMod! Now you can continue 
# to the next one or play around with some python code!

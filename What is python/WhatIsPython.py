# What is python?

# Python is a powerful programming language!
# It can be used for many things and is easy to learn!
# Down below is a piece of python code that prints out the text "Hello World!"

print("Hello World!")

# The above piece of code runs a command called print()
# and inside the brackets is what you want it to print.
# Notice how you must put quotation marks to specify that
# it is a piece of text? You don't have to just print out text.
# You can also print out variables, which I will get to in
# a later LearnMod. Doing that would look like this:

number = 6
print(number)
# The above code would print out the number 6.


# These are very basic commands. Each command does something different.
# You can even make your own commands which looks a bit like this:

def Hello():
    print("Hello!")

Hello()
# Notice that you have to define your command
# before you can run it.


# The def command (which is short for "define") specifies
# that you want to make your own command. You then put the
# name of the command and you MUST put brackets at the end.
# You then type in what you want your custom command to do.
# It must have an indent/four spaces.


# So now I have shown you some code,
# I want you to try and complete the challenge.py file.
# Also, every python file has the .py file extension a bit like .txt, .exe etc.
